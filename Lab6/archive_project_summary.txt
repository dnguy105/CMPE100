Name      = Lab6
Directory = C:/Users/dnguy105/Desktop/Lab6

WARNING: Please verify the compiled library directory path for the following property in the

         This could happen if the project was unarchived in a location where this path is not
         accessible. To resolve this issue, please set this property with the desired path
         before launching simulation:-

Property = compxlib.xsim_compiled_library_dir
Path     =
